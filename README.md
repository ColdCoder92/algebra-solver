# Algebra Solver Demo
The application, created using JavaFX, would allow the user to solve any algebra problem just by typing it. As an aside, an ice-cream character accompanies the app while you interact with the input. Currently, the app accepts simple expressions and linear equations with simplification, integers, decimals, and fractions. Also, the Dark Mode setting is still in the works.

From the bottom, the development started with planning on how to solve the most simple equations beginning with x + 1 = 2. Then, gradually, the code got more complex after testing with harder equations and debugging for any strenuous bugs. The layout of the application was created with experimenting along with the bottom-up process as graphics were involved in the process. The result led to a main menu with the start, settings, and exit buttons as would many applications.
